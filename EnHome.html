<h2>PROJECT EXPERIENCE</h2>

<a href="https://github.com/waitfou/douyin-Mr-Wang"><b>Back end project of imitating Tiktok</b></a>
<ul>
<li><b>Technical Selection</b>： SpringBoot、MySQL、Redis、MongoDB、Nginx、Nacos<br />
<li>Mainly completing video comment module, fan module, system message, user verification, video module, etc. Using Maven to build and manage the project, using the Spring Boot framework to improve development efficiency, and utilizing knife4j for backend interface management
Decoupling important data and system messages with RabbitMQ to improve system availability and efficiency
<li>Using Redis to complete counting of followers, followers, likes, etc., caching data that does not need to be immediately stored in the database (friend relationships/video likes/token session information/cache verification codes (and setting expiration policies), and setting a threshold to persist data when the threshold is reached
To database
<li>Use the Nacos distributed configuration center to extract the parameters that need to be configured for dynamic modification, and use IdWorker to achieve distributed global ID generation.
<li>Completed the deployment of cloud servers. API testing link:http://47.115.222.30:8099/doc.html
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Waitfou/raft-kv-master"><b>Implementation of K-V Distributed Storage Based on Raft Algorithm</b></a><br />
<ul>
<li><b>Technical Selection</b>：Java、Rocks-DB、SOFA-BOlt、thread pool、JUC、lombok、Slf4j<br />
<li>This project uses Java language and is implemented in strict accordance with Raft's paper (leader election and log copy are realized). Using the slf4j log framework to print logs, Rocks DB to store KV logs in the state machine, and Ant Financial's SOFA Bolt framework for RPC at different nodes
Communication, etc<br>
<li>Independently implement consistency algorithm modules, log modules, election modules, etc. It also completes leader election voting, appends logs, processes requests sent by clients to the cluster, and manages threads through the Thread pool<br>
<li>Independently responsible for the Leader election module, completing the Leader election in the event of server node downtime/server cluster startup, etc<br/>
<li>Independently responsible for the log replication module, ensuring strong consistency with the Leader node to synchronize the log information in the Cluster Follower node with the Leader node<br />
</li>
</ul>
<b>Research on Abnormal Detection of Vehicle Body Spot Welding Based on Machine Learning Algorithms [Horizontal Project Collaborated with GAC Honda]</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Technical Selection</b>： Python、Numpy、Pandas、Sklearn<br />
<li>Achievement: A basic process framework for model online learning was constructed, and basic development was completed. The second version was launched on the production line of GAC Honda, improving the efficiency of anomaly detection and reducing labor costs. Responsible for: data interface, data preprocessing, model algorithms
The constructed algorithm has a stable anomaly recall rate of over 95% and a false alarm rate of less than 4%
